The perpetrator was spotted on Bind, having an immensely overflated ego and huge amounts of cope. Perpetrator was malding in round 1 for Elo Police bringing the spike to the "wrong" bombsite, when in fact the Elo Police entried and got 3 kills, and we won the round. Coping in won rounds is a major offense.
