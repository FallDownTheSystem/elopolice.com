The perpetrator was spotted on Bind, having an immensely overflated ego and huge amounts of PMS. The perpetrator was coping about not getting initations from Breach, while claiming the Elo Police was doing nothing when in fact they were both topfragging and doing all the entries. The perpetrator was also bottomfragging the majority of the game. Additionally the perpetrator would try to insult fellow teammates with comments about them being hardstuck low elo ascendants, when in fact the perpetrator was an ascendant themselves.
